Here are the programs I wrote and the reports I made for the course project of EE798R.

The Project was divided into two tasks: 
1. To understand and implement the clustering algorithm as described in in the paper [Deep Density Clustering of Unconstrained Faces](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Lin_Deep_Density_Clustering_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf) and test it on multiple datasets.
2. To improve the algorithm and get better results than achieved in Part 1.

PS: I got 35/35 Marks in the course project!
